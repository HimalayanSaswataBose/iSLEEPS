# iSLEEPS preprocessing

This repository has been made to help searcher to have a quick start on analysing the iSLEEPS dataset available here in iHUB-data:
[iSLEEPS dataset](link).

## Introduction
This dataset contains data from externalized DBS patients undergoing simultaneous MEG - STN LFP recordings with (MedOn) and without (MedOn) dopaminergic medication. It has two movement conditions: 1) 5 min of rest followed by static forearm extension (hold) and 2) 5 min of rest followed by self-paced fist-clenching (move). The movement parts contain pauses. Some patients were recorded in resting-state only (rest). The project aimed to understand the neurophysiology of basal ganglia-cortex loops and its modulation by movement and medication.
